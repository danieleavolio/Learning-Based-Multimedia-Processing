# Questions 1**

[How to go from analogue to digital?](#How-to-go-from-analogue-to-digital)

The main technique is **sampling**. Discratization in time. Take a signal and every so often take a sample of it. This is the basis of digital signal processing.

[Sampling theorem](#Sampling-theorem)

f_s > 2f_max

That means that the sampling frequency must be greater than twice the maximum frequency of the signal.

[What is a problem of subsampling images?](#What-is-a-problem-of-subsampling-images)

Strange effect like Moir√© patterns. This is because the sampling frequency is too low.

[What is quantization?](#What-is-quantization)

Discretization in amplitude. The value of the sample is rounded to the nearest value in a finite set of values. 
This is done to reduce the number of bits needed to represent the signal.

[What is multimedia processing?](#What-is-multimedia-processing)

Multimedia processing is a discipline that takes advantages on all types of media, that can be written, recorder, smelled, etc, to derive solutions.

[How humans perceive images?](#How-humans-perceive-images)

Humans perceive images by the light that is reflected from the objects. The light is captured by the eyes and the brain processes the information.

[What is retinotopy](#What-is-retinotopy)

Retinal images on the brain

[What does cochlea do?](#What-does-cochlea-do)

The cochlea is a spiral-shaped cavity in the inner ear that produces nerve impulses in response to sound vibrations. Converts time dependent sound information to its frequency spectrum like fourier transform.

[What is HVS](#What-is-HVS)

Human Visual System

[What are the 2 types of visual sensors in humans?](#What-are-the-2-types-of-visual-sensors-in-humans)

- Rods: Sensitive to black and white information. Around 75-150 millions and they have nice night vision.
- Cones: Sensitive to color information. Around 6-7 millions. Care about photopic vision, that is the vision in the daylight.
 
[How are cones and rods distributed over the area of the eye?](#How-are-cones-and-rods-distributed-over-the-area-of-the-eye)

Rods are distributed over the retina, cones are more int he back of the eye.

[What is the blind spot?](#What-is-the-blind-spot)

The blind spot is the point where the optic nerve leaves the eye. There are no rods or cones in this area, and so there is no information detected in this area.

[What is retina and fovea](#What-is-retina-and-fovea)

Fovea provides nice high resolution vision and occupies a small area of the retina.

[What is brightness adaption?](#What-is-brightness-adaption)

HVS can adapt to a large range of brightness levels. To do so, it changes the sensitivity of the rods and cones to the light.

[What is intensity discrimination?](#What-is-intensity-discrimination)

The ability to distinguish between different intensities of light. For example, the ability to distinguish between different shades of grey.
Weber ratio is the minimum difference in intensity that can be detected.
The lower the ratio, the better the discrimination. 
To increase the ratio, for humans is good to have a good illumination in the background.

[Simultaneous contrast](#Simultaneous-contrast)

A region perceived brighter when surrounded by a darker region doesn't depend only on the intensity of the region, but also on the intensity of the surrounding region.
