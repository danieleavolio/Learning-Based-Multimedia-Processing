<p align="center">Questions by <b>Daniele Avolio - ist1111559</b></p>

### Question 1:

*About the temporal information from video frames, since you said that your frames are independent in your model, how that relation to previous frames would be useful for the task?* 

### Question 2:

*You said that the time the model takes to process an image, with a regular computer, is 4.8s. Is this considering a GPU or a CPU? Moreover, other than using a more powerful computer, what are the other ways to make this process faster? Do you think that the architecture should be changed a lot to make it faster?*

### Question 3:

*About the training and test data difference, do you think that the preprocessing phase for the training data could be improved to make the model more robust and to better generalize the data?*
